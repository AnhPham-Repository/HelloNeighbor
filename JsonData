The player can also pick up bear traps and use them against the Neighbor, but they can only be picked up if the trap is closed.

First, go inside your own house it is right behind you.\n Pick up something to smash a window with (e.g. the TV set) and two cardboard boxes \n Now, go towards the rack visible in the screenshot above. Stack two boxes (one on the top of) another this will allow you to access the roof. Jump on the roof visible in the screenshot above. You have to sprint before the jump watch out not to jump too far, though. Continue along the room and break the first window to the left. Use it to enter the room. There, you can find a lever that allows you to move the platform presented in the picture. Also, there is a fan next to that lever you can use it to move the lever but you need to provide power to it first. The picture (the biggest one), presented in the screenshot, is located in the room with the lever. Take it and add to your inventory this reveals a hole in the wall and gives you access to another room. Go there. Inside, you can find the switch presented in the screenshot. Use it this activates the fan. Now, you have to move the lever (the one that controls the platform) in a such way that the platform would be on the ground (the lever needs to be moved up). Then, place an item (e.g. a box) on the shelve with the fan it starts moving until it reaches the lever and activates it. In the meantime, you have to quickly get on the platform you have to reach it before the item moves the lever. After going up on the platform and enter the room. The neighbor might hear you, so stay vigilant. On the table, to your left, there is the red key. Pick it up. Interestingly enough, after being caught by the neighbor, there is a chance you will be taken to another location in order to exit it, go towards the door visible in the screenshot above. Now, you have to enter neighbor's house. Best do it using the front door. Then, immediately enter the first room to the right. The neighbor is bound to hear you so you have to be quick. Inside the room, you can find the door with the red lock. Use the key you found earlier on the lock to enter a new location. Open the washing machine visible above. This will allow you to continue. For now, you do not have to worry about the neighbor he will show up later on. Continue forward until you reach the room with the pallet. Pick up the can. Break one of the windows and use it to leave the room. Go leftwards and use the lever visible on the left hand side of the screenshot above. This will open the grid. Continue forward until you reach the place visible above. You can find a flashlight there (where the light is) it is worth taking it, as the location is dark. Use the next lever (next to the dummy) and enter another room. Inside, you see the painting visible above. Lay it down on the nearby fence just put the painting on the ground and flip it by pushing it with your character. This will allow you to go over the fence. Turn the generator on. Without it, you cannot leave this location. Using the pile of items visible above you can jump over the fence. Open the first door and enter the room. Continue forward and open consecutive doors (always the ones you find first). Finally, you encounter the neighbor. You do not have to run away it is actually better to get caught. This way you get to the start of the location you were headed anyway. Go to the room where you flipped the painting. Watch out for the neighbor, as he is patrolling the area. Use the level visible above (previously, it was not active, because the generator was not turned on). After reaching the corridor visible above, you will be chased by the neighbor run towards the end of the corridor until you reach the door.

Before doing it, though, take the crowbar presented in the screenshot above. At the moment, you cannot pick it up as it is hot, nonetheless, it cools after a while. Now you can jump down. Take the umbrella that you can find there it will be very useful later on. Stand on the platform and throw something (e.g. a chair or a cardboard box) at the switch presented above. This will result in moving the platform up. After reaching the top, open the door leading to the new location. In this location, you need to have to reach the end of the hall with a trolley filled with five different products. Dummies will try to interrupt should they approach you, you will have to start over and the products disappear from the trolley. If you see a dummy coming closer, simply crouch. It should lose its interest in you. If that did not happen, run. The products you need to have in your trolley are visible in the screenshot above you can find all of them on the shelves next to the track. You cannot leave this location without these products. After passing the cash register, go towards the door with the Exit sign on them. This way, you return to your neighbor's house. Go to the back of the house and approach the small window visible above using a cardboard box. Switch the lever through the window to open the doors inside the house.
